Problem:
	Input: User input search string into the form
	Output: The web page shows a list of all the chapter titles (with links) that include that search term.

	Rules:
		# does casing matter? I don't know.

Examples:
	# Search(Cat)
		A Cat in the Hat
		A Man Drains the Pain --> both include the word (Cat)

Data Structures:
	# Create a hash to store the chapter titles (what will be viewed) as keys
	# and the chapter words as the values
	# @contents is an array of the titles
	# Use Dir class to get the contents of each chapter and put them in the value

Algorithm:
	# HELPER create hash
	# iterate through @contents with each with index
	#  take the current element in contents and make it the key
		# for the value at the current element in the directory.

	# HELPER select keys
		# Take the query search in the params hash
		# if the value in the chapters_hash includes the search, select that key/value pair
		# take the selections and return the keys. 	

	# View Template Search:
		# Create a list of all the selected Titles. Each item in the list should also be a link.
		# Iterate through with each
		# need the number associated with the chapter. Shit! hahahha	

	# layout view and Home view
	# Create a search link in the Table of Contents list in layout / home
